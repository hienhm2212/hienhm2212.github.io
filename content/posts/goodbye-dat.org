Today, one of my closest teammates left the company. His name is Dat.

* Four Years

Four years is a long time in tech. Long enough to survive bad sprints, late-night deploys,
and product pivots that made no sense at the time. Long enough that you stop being just
coworkers and start being something more — teammates, friends, something close to brothers.

Dat was all of that.

* What Made Him Different

He was sharp. The kind of engineer who didn't just solve the problem in front of him —
he understood /why/ it was a problem in the first place. Working alongside him made me
a better engineer, not because he ever said "do it this way," but because watching him
think raised the bar quietly, consistently.

He helped me a lot — more than I probably told him. And outside of work, he was the
guy you wanted on your team in a game just as much as in a codebase. Funny, competitive,
always good energy.

* On People Leaving

Leaving isn't the same as disappearing. The best people outgrow places — that's not a
failure of the place or the person, it's just how growth works. Dat moving on means
he found something worth chasing. That's worth celebrating.

* To Dat

Wherever you land next, you'll make that team better. You always do.

Thanks for the four years. Go build something great.
