I didn't plan to learn Go. [Tell the story of how you started — a project, a recommendation, curiosity?]

* Why Go?

Coming from [Ruby/other language], Go felt [strange/refreshing/confusing] at first.
What drew me in was [simplicity, performance, concurrency, the tooling?].

* The First Stumbling Blocks

The things that tripped me up early on:

- *Error handling* — no exceptions, just =if err != nil=. At first it felt verbose,
  but now [how do you feel about it?]
- *No inheritance* — coming from OOP, I had to rethink how to structure code
- *Goroutines* — [your experience with concurrency?]

#+BEGIN_SRC go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // The first Go program I wrote that actually made sense to me
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
#+END_SRC

* What Clicked

The moment everything started to make sense was [describe the "aha" moment].

[A specific project or problem you solved in Go]

* What I'm Still Learning

Go is deceptively simple on the surface, but [interfaces, channels, context, generics?]
still challenge me. Currently exploring:

- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]

* Would I Recommend It?

[Your honest take — who is Go good for? What kind of problems does it solve well?]
