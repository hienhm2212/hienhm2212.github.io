#+TITLE: How I Built This Blog with Org-mode

No Hugo, no Jekyll, no JavaScript framework. Just Emacs, Org-mode, and a shell script.

* Why Not Just Use Hugo or Jekyll?

[Your reasoning — wanted to stay in Emacs? Learn org-publish? Keep it simple?]

* What is org-publish?

=org-publish= is a built-in Emacs package that converts Org-mode files to HTML.
The entire blog is driven by a single =publish.el= config file.

The core idea:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(("my-blog"
         :base-directory "./content/"
         :publishing-directory "./public/"
         :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html)))
#+END_SRC

* The Project Structure

#+BEGIN_SRC
my-blog/
├── content/          ← where I write
│   ├── posts/        ← blog posts
│   ├── assets/       ← CSS, images
│   └── about.org
├── publish.el        ← the entire build config
├── build.sh          ← one-line build script
└── public/           ← generated output (git-ignored)
#+END_SRC

* Challenges I Ran Into

- [Challenge 1 — e.g. about.org not being published]
- [Challenge 2 — e.g. avatar not showing]
- [Challenge 3 — e.g. build.sh not triggering publish]

* Deploying with GitHub Actions

The whole blog builds on GitHub's servers with one workflow:

1. Install Emacs
2. Run =bash build.sh=
3. Deploy =public/= to GitHub Pages

Total cost: $0.

* What I'd Do Differently

[Any regrets or things you'd change about the setup?]
