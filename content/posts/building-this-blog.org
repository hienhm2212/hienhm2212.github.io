#+TITLE: How I Built This Blog with Org-mode

No Hugo, no Jekyll, no JavaScript framework. Just Emacs, Org-mode, and a shell script.

* Why Not Just Use Hugo or Jekyll?

While Hugo and Jekyll are excellent, they introduced a "context switch" I wanted to avoid.
I didn't want to leave my editor to preview a site or learn a specific templating engine like Go Templates or Liquid.
By using org-publish, my blog isn't just about my notes—it is my notes. I wanted a system that was:

1. Portable: No dependencies other than Emacs.

2. Simple: A single Lisp file controls the entire build.

3. Future-proof: As long as Emacs exists, my blog can be compiled.

* What is org-publish?

=org-publish= is a built-in Emacs package that converts Org-mode files to HTML.
The entire blog is driven by a single =publish.el= config file.

The core idea:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(("my-blog"
	 :base-directory "./content/"
	 :publishing-directory "./public/"
	 :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html)))
#+END_SRC

* The Project Structure

#+BEGIN_SRC
my-blog/
├── content/          ← where I write
│   ├── posts/        ← blog posts
│   ├── assets/       ← CSS, images
│   └── about.org
├── publish.el        ← the entire build config
├── build.sh          ← one-line build script
└── public/           ← generated output (git-ignored)
#+END_SRC

* Challenges I Ran Into

- The CSS "Specificity" War: Since I don't write the HTML tags myself, I had to learn how Org-mode
structures its output. It uses specific classes like .outline-2, .title, and #postamble. My first
attempt at CSS looked broken because I wasn't targeting the IDs and classes Emacs generates by default.
I eventually had to use M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url just to inspect the elements and see why my padding was off!

* Deploying with GitHub Actions

The whole blog builds on GitHub's servers with one workflow:

1. Install Emacs
2. Run =bash build.sh=
3. Deploy =public/= to GitHub Pages

Total cost: $0.
