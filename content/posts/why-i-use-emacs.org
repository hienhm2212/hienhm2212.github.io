#+TITLE: Why I Use Emacs in 2026

Everyone has an opinion about editors. Here's mine.

* How It Started

I followed the typical path: Atom, VS Code, and Sublime Text. Emacs wasn't even on my radar
util I saw my mentor using it. Watching them navigate complex files without ever touching a
mouse looked like magic - it was the first time I saw someone truly "speak" to their computer.

* The Learning Curve Is Real

I won't lie — the first week was painful.
Between wrestling with the configuration files and memorizing =C-x= and =M-x= keybindings,
I felt like a beginner again.

However,  unlike other tools, every hour I put into Emacs felt like
an *investment* rather than a cost. In VS Code, you learn a tool; in Emacs, you learn a way of thinking.

* What Keeps Me Here

The things I can't give up now:

- *Org-mode:* It's more than a format; it's an ecosystem. I use it for everything from task
management and structured note-taking to literate programming and professional
presentations.
- *The Operating System inside an Emacs:* Whether it's managing files with Dired, checking
email with Mu4e or listen to music, I never have to leave the home row.
- *Infinite Hackability:* Emacs is essentially a massive Lisp environment. If a feature doesn't
exist or a keybinding feels of, I can rewrite it in real-time.

* Example My Setup for Go

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; The packages I actually use day-to-day
(use-package go-mode
  :ensure t
  :mode "\\.go\\'"
  :custom
  (go-ts-mode-indent-offset 4)
  :bind (:map go-mode-map
	      ("C-c C-d" . godoc-at-point)
	      ("C-c C-a" . go-import-add)
	      ("C-c C-r" . go-remove-unused-imports))
  :hook
  ((go-mode go-ts-mode) . (lambda ()
			    (setq-local indent-tabs-mode t)
			    (setq-local tab-width 4)
			    (add-hook 'before-save-hook #'my-go-before-save -10 t))))

#+END_SRC

* The Honest Downsides

Emacs is not perfect. The complexity can be overwhelming, and it's hard to "onboard" teammates
who are used to standard shortcuts. You often spend more time "sharpening the saw"
(fixing your config) than actually cutting wood.

* Should You Learn It?

If you want a tool that grows with you for the next 20 years, then yes.
And let’s be honest—it still makes you look like the coolest person in the coffee shop.
