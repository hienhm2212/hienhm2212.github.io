Everyone has an opinion about editors. Here's mine.

* How It Started

I started with Atom, VSCode, SublimeText, .... Emacs wasn't even on my radar until
i saw my mentor used it. It so cool, like hacker, he didn't need a mouse.

* The Learning Curve Is Real

I won't lie — the first week was painful.

[Describe a specific struggle: keybindings, config, terminology?]
First, I don't understand about the config, then I must remember 
the keybindings. It's hard 

But unlike other tools, every hour I put into Emacs felt like
an investment rather than a cost.

* What Keeps Me Here

The things I can't give up now:

- *Org-mode* — I have learned it, then use for tasks, notes, literate code, presentation, etc.
- Emacs can do every the system does (File management, Music, Email, Web, ...)
- *Everything is hackable* — You can customize everything you want. 

* My Setup for [Go/Rails/etc.]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; The packages I actually use day-to-day
(use-package go-mode
  :ensure t
  :mode "\\.go\\'"
  :custom
  (go-ts-mode-indent-offset 4)
  :bind (:map go-mode-map
              ("C-c C-d" . godoc-at-point)
              ("C-c C-a" . go-import-add)
              ("C-c C-r" . go-remove-unused-imports))
  :hook
  ((go-mode go-ts-mode) . (lambda ()
                            (setq-local indent-tabs-mode t)
                            (setq-local tab-width 4)
                            (add-hook 'before-save-hook #'my-go-before-save -10 t))))

* The Honest Downsides

Emacs is not perfect. [Startup time? Complexity? Hard to onboard teammates?]

* Should You Learn It?

Yes, if you want to look cool, write
